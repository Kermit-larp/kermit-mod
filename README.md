Lines Map Mod by Hasen,
Duhamel Map Font by Jupiter and the Throne of Lorraine dev team,
A few provinces and tags borrowed from Harald's Triumph and Greater Flavor Mod.

Special thanks to Jupiter and all of the guys in the Throne of Lorraine Discord server for giving a place for the mod and helping a ton with suggestions :D
